# Neural Network Projects

This repository is composed by different projects that use neural networks 
to solve a problem or perform some task. The problems tackled are simple 
enough to be solved with really simple models. The objective is trying to 
explain each step of the process for each of them in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org) 
as well as well as providing python scripts to perform the job. Model will 
be built using different libraries ([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), 
[Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), etc).

### Project requirements

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow==1.9


## Available models

- ### Mushrooms classification
    The objective of this project is to classify mushrooms into 'edible' and 'poisonous'.
    The original competition was hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)
     - **Neural Network:** Stack of fully connected layers with non-linear activations 
        and a sigmoid output layer.
     - **Project:** [mushrooms](https://github.com/fiquinho/neural-network-projects/tree/master/mushrooms)
